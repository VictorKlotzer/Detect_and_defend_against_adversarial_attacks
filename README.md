4GM interdisciplinary project report
by: Anna Kerebel, Florian Jacta, Rose Guionnet, Swen Laurent, Théo Di Piazza and Victor Klötzer
referents: Ayse Nur Arlsan and Wassim Hamidouche

The file named 'project_notebook' contains the three parts of our project: the creation of deep neural networks and the generation of attacks, the compution of MSCN coefficients, and a last part with statistical testing and finally the creation of an adversarial attacks detector.
